# Privacy Policy - Cocktography for IRCCloud

**Last Updated:** December 2024

## Data Collection by This Extension

**We collect nothing.** This extension does not:
- Collect, store, or transmit any personal information
- Track your browsing activity
- Send data to external servers
- Use analytics or telemetry
- Share data with third parties

## Local Storage Only

The extension stores your preferences locally in your browser:
- Encoding mode (THIN_CHODE, WIDE_CHODE, MIXED_CHODE)
- Stroke count setting
- Cockblock size preference
- Auto-encode/auto-decode toggles

This data never leaves your device.

## What Happens When You Use IRC

**Important:** While this extension doesn't collect data, using IRC inherently transmits information:

- **Messages you encode and send** are transmitted to IRC servers and visible to other users in the channel
- **Your IRC username and connection** are managed by IRCCloud/your IRC client, not this extension
- **Encoded messages are NOT encrypted** - they're steganographic (hidden in plain sight), not secure communication

This extension only encodes/decodes text locally in your browser. Once you send a message through IRCCloud, it's subject to [IRCCloud's privacy policy](https://www.irccloud.com/privacy) and the policies of any IRC networks you connect to.

## Open Source

All code is open source and auditable. You can verify exactly what this extension does by reviewing the source code included with the extension.

## Questions?

This extension is provided as-is. If you have privacy concerns, review the source code or don't use the extension.
